# MS Word Editing Templates


### How do you display code snippets in MS Word preserving format and syntax highlighting?
Here is the best way, for me, to add code inside word:
1. go to Insert tab, Text section, click object button (it's on the right)
2. choose OpenDocument Text which will open a new embedded word document
3. copy and paste your code from Visual Studio / Eclipse inside this embedded word page
4. save and close

The result looks very nice. Here are the advantages of this method:
1. the code keeps its original layout and colors
2. the code is separated from the rest of the document, as if it was a picture or a chart
3. spelling errors won't be highlighted in the code (this is cool !)

And it takes only few seconds.
